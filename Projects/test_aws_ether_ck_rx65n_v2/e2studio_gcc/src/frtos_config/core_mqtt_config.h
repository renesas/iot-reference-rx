/**
* @brief The maximum duration between non-empty network reads while
* receiving an MQTT packet via the #MQTT_ProcessLoop or #MQTT_ReceiveLoop
* API functions.
*
* When an incoming MQTT packet is detected, the transport receive function
* may be called multiple times until all of the expected number of bytes of the
* packet are received. This timeout represents the maximum polling duration that
* is allowed without any data reception from the network for the incoming packet.
*
* If the timeout expires, the #MQTT_ProcessLoop and #MQTT_ReceiveLoop functions
* return #MQTTRecvFailed.
*
* @note If a dummy implementation of the #MQTTGetCurrentTimeFunc_t timer function,
* is supplied to the library, then #MQTT_RECV_POLLING_TIMEOUT_MS MUST be set to 0.
*
* <b>Possible values:</b> Any positive 32 bit integer. Recommended to use a
* small timeout value. <br>
* <b>Default value:</b> `10`
*
