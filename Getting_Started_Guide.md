```text
> conf set thingname <iot-thing name>
OK.
```

 ![4-1-6](https://github.com/renesas/iot-reference-rx/wiki/getting_started_guide_image/step4_1_6_3thingname.PNG?raw=true)  

Next, set the mqtt endpoint to the endpoint for your account:

```text
> conf set endpoint <endpoint for your account>
OK.
```

 ![4-1-6](https://github.com/renesas/iot-reference-rx/wiki/getting_started_guide_image/step4_1_6_4endpoint.PNG?raw=true)  

**Note:** You can determine the endpoint for your AWS account with the ```aws iot describe-endpoint``` command or on the *Domain configurations* page of the AWS IoT Core console.

###### Set security information of target device

Next, set the device certificate:  
Drag and drop "xxxx-certificate.pem.crt" generated in [Step 4-1-3: Create RSA key pair and device certificate for PubSub demo](#step-4-1-3-create-rsa-key-pair-and-device-certificate-for-pubsub-demo) to Tera Term.

```text
> conf set cert <Drag and drop crt file>
```

 ![4-1-6](https://github.com/renesas/iot-reference-rx/wiki/getting_started_guide_image/step4_1_6_5cert.PNG?raw=true)  

**Note:** About \<device certificate\>, if you use Tera Term, drag and drop the certificate file onto the Terminal screen after entered `conf set cert` , then select `Send File (Paste content of file)` on the screen that appears, and press `OK`. The contents of the certificate file will be entered.

Next, set the device private key:  
Drag and drop "xxxx-private.pem.key" generated in [Step 4-1-3: Create RSA key pair and device certificate for PubSub demo](#step-4-1-3-create-rsa-key-pair-and-device-certificate-for-pubsub-demo) to Tera Term.

```text
> conf set key <Drag and drop key file>
```

 ![4-1-6](https://github.com/renesas/iot-reference-rx/wiki/getting_started_guide_image/step4_1_6_6.PNG?raw=true) 

**Note:** About \<private key\>, if you use Tera Term, drag and drop the certificate file onto the Terminal screen after entered `conf set key` , then select `Send File (Paste content of file)` on the screen that appears, and press `OK`. The contents of the certificate file will be entered.

###### Commit configuration changes

Next, commit the staged configuration changes to Data Flash:

```text
> conf commit
```

![4-1-6](https://github.com/renesas/iot-reference-rx/wiki/getting_started_guide_image/step4_1_6_7.PNG?raw=true)  

###### Reset the target device and restart demo

Finally, reset the target device once by the following command to restart demo:

```text
> reset
```

![4-1-6](https://github.com/renesas/iot-reference-rx/wiki/getting_started_guide_image/step4_1_6_8.png?raw=true)

##### Step 4-1-8: Expected output for PubSub demo

After restart demo, wait a seconds with input nothing via CLI. Then demo is performed with the following output.

* **PubSub Demo Task 0** and **PubSub Demo Task 1** can complete successfully.  
![4-1-7](https://github.com/renesas/iot-reference-rx/wiki/getting_started_guide_image/step4_1_7_1_l3_1.png?raw=true)

##### Step 4-1-9: Check messages with the AWS MQTT test client

Once you configure the MQTT test client in [Step 4-1-5](#step-4-1-5-aws-mqtt-test-client-settings), you will be able to see the messages sent from the pubsub demo on AWS.

* Display the MQTT test client website you set in [Step 4-1-5](#step-4-1-5-aws-mqtt-test-client-settings).
* You can get message "*Task x publishing message x*" published to **MQTT test client** console.  
If successful, it will be displayed on AWS console as shown below.![4-1-7](https://github.com/renesas/iot-reference-rx/wiki/getting_started_guide_image/step4_1_7_3.PNG?raw=true)

## Troubleshooting

### Improve timeout when connection error happens

If an error occurs during communication due to the communication environment, changing each definition to the following "correction value" may improve the problem.  

|Definition Name|Description|default value|correction value|path|
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
|mqttexampleTRANSPORT_SEND_RECV_TIMEOUT_MS| Timeout in milliseconds to send and receive in the transport layer. You try to change the value to more bigger when you met TLS handshake error. Changes in this value affect the time of MQTT communication. So you should adjust the value of time according to your communication environment. |450|`750`|Demos\mqtt_agent\mqtt_agent_task.c|
|MQTT_AGENT_MAX_EVENT_QUEUE_WAIT_TIME|Time in milliseconds that the MQTT agent task will wait in the Blocked state (so not using any CPU time) for a command to arrive in its command queue before exiting the blocked state so it can call MQTT_ProcessLoop().|50U|`1000U`|src\frtos_config\core_mqtt_agent_config.h|

However, each definition affects the execution time of the demo.  
If the above values are set, the execution time of the demo may increase.  

### How to change MAC Address

The MAC address used in the sample project can be changed using the Smart Configurator.  
The MAC address assigned to your board can be found on a sticker on the board's Ethernet connector.  
If the sticker is not attached, please check [Tool News](https://www.renesas.com/document/tnn/notification-information-about-ck-rx65n-mac-address?r=1611756).  
![TroubleShooting_0_1_MAC_Address_Board](https://github.com/renesas/iot-reference-rx/wiki/getting_started_guide_image/TroubleShooting_0_1_MAC_Address_Board_v2.png)  
MAC Address can be changed from FreeRTOS Kernel of the Smart Configurator.  
Change Components-> FreeRTOS Kernel-> MAC address X (X = 0 to 5).  
After changing the settings, be sure to **Generate Code** and **Build**.
